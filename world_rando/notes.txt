Worley pattern ideas:

To split up rooms, distribute n means through the map
	now, run a series of steps with randomized BFS (shuffle the queue every time?) for each mean.
	a mean "claims" the territory that it searches - one mean cannot claim territory already claimed by another mean
	keep going until all available territory has been claimed.

How to decide on value of n?


This technique might also be able to create a partition of the map for deciding what 'aesthetic area' each room is in!
