# This file encodes the save rooms, which use pointers into the door data table to work
# Since we randomize that table, we have to also re-write the save data bank
# ROOM is the room with the save point (name as per the rooms.txt file)
# Door is which door in the save room is used for the save.
# 	For example, Landing_Site_L2 is the reference door for the ship save:
#	if Landing_Site_L2 is hooked up to Halfie_Climb_R1, then the pointer to the door data for Halfie_Climb_R1 needs to be written to OFFSET in order to make the landing site save work.
