# Tags:
# R# - run for # spaces /before/ jumping (on an additional tile - a jump made from a single tile would be R0)
# C - crouch-jump
# ITEM - need to use that item - assume without if the flag is not present

# Colors:
# Red - Initial position (must be air)
# Green - Final position (must be air)
# Yellow - Air
# Black - Solid
## TODO: Slope down is "solid" technically, but some of these jumps are not possible when the height gets smaller...
## TODO: Differentiate between spin samus and springball samus...


# Each jump with hjb, with speed booster
# Mockball springjump? lol
# Need to know horizontal fall speed too...
# Air reversal gains height?
# Air reversal for "vertical" spin jump / dodging obstacles
#	- vertical spin jump is same height as normal jump (except no crouch possible)
# Slope jumps?
# Consider short jumps by not holding A?
# WALL JUMPS
#	- chain walljumps as a separate rule??
# Bomb Jump
# walking / running
# grapple beam (+grippers)
# space jump
# ripper ice beam...
# walk/run off platform
# falling
# bomb jump
# speed boost?? (later)
# morph / unmorph
#	- as a rule, do not want 2-high gaps to morphstuck
# UNDERWATER / UNDERLAVA / UNDERACID rules
# some way for introducing a new platform to split old big jumps into two (so that the platform may be placed in the path of the previous jumps...)
#	-> "ownership" of blank space to avoid double collisions?

# To handle partial jump rule applications, we combine two methods
# We add two things to the current state:
# one tuple which is a measure of horizontal speed ex. (R, 4)
# one tuple which is a measure of vertical speed ex. (J, 2)
# R4 indicates that samus has run 4 spaces and thus has max (speedboosterless) run speed. Higher number is faster.
# possible values for horizontal speed are:
# (W, R, G, SPB) -- G for grapple and I'm not really sure how it will work...
# As well as the symmetrical lefthand versions.
# Horizontal speed indicates which falling rule(s) to apply when you hit the ceiling or the top of a jump.
# For vertical, J4 indicates that samus has jumped 4 vertical spaces using normal jump. Lower number is faster.
# possible values for vertical speed are:
# (J, HJ, SJ, SHJ, SPBJ, SPBHJ, WJ, WHJ, SBHJ, SBJ, G)
# Vertical speed indicates which (partial) jumping rule(s) may be applied for the rest of a jump
#
# We add an annotation to the rules, which indicates what direction samus will encounter a block during a jump.
# blocks that will be encountered vertically set the samus position to below them and zero out her vertical speed.
# blocks that will be encountered horizontally set the samus position to beside them (assume lower) and zero out her horizontal speed.
# then, you trigger either the appropriate falling rule, or trigger the appropriate last half of a jump rule into a fall rule (ad hoc)

# Rule cost should be determined pixel-by-pixel, with rules only paying for /introducing/ additional tiles. If a rule uses squares that were already there,
# it doesn't incur costs for those tiles
